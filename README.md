# bugger-v8-client (original readme)

Wonder what this thing does.

# More useful readme

This project provides an implementation and API to the unpopular but powerful nodejs debugging interface (that is actually v8-debug-interface). When you start nodejs with --debug flag, it starts TCP server that listens to the simple JSON rpc protocol, described [here](./PROTOCOL.md).

**TODO:** write API docs here.
